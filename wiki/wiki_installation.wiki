#summary how to setup SMW using shell script via SVN client
#labels Phase-Implementation,Featured

= Introduction =
We write several shell scripts (bash) to help users install SMW using SVN client. Such installation allows users to (i) install the latest version of wiki codes and extensions, and (ii) update the installation with the latest patches distributed via SVN.

=Prerequisites=
 * SVN client must be installed. the following code may help you install SVN client (if your linux support yum and you can log in as root).  
{{{
yum install subversion
}}}  

The following requirements are similar to [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Installation the requirements by mediawiki installation]
 * mysql 4.0 or higher version has been installed and running. you should have enough privilege to create a database and grant privileges. That ensures that you can install a media wiki database.
 * apache web server (httpd) 2.0 or higher version has been installed and is running. the root directory is < WWW-ROOT >
 * PHP 5.0 or higher version has been installed. php-mysql, ... has been configured with apache web server.

note: we only support linux with bash scripts

= Installation =
1. open a linux console, and create a directory for your wikis
{{{
mkdir <WWW-ROOT>/wiki
cd <WWW-ROOT>/wiki
}}}

2. download all setup scripts (some depends on some others), and make them executable
{{{
svn checkout http://smwbp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/setup
mv setup/*  .
rm -rf setup
chmod +x *.sh
}}}
hint: you may review the setup scripts at http://code.google.com/p/smwbp/source/browse/#svn/trunk/setup

3. execute one setup script to install a wiki at < MY-WIKI-PATH > 
{{{
./setup-smw.sh install <MY-WIKI-PATH>
}}}
hint: you will see a sequence of shell command executed, they are essentially downloading the wiki codes from several Web hosts.

4. install mediawiki using [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Config_script MW setup instructions]. typically you will need to do the following
{{{
bash# cd <MY-WIKI-PATH>
bash# chmod a+w config/
...goto your wiki url and use web installation
...
mv config/LocalSettings.php .
}}}

5. append the following lines  to the end of LocalSettings.php
{{{
require_once( "extensions/SMWBP/LocalSettings.smwbp.smw.php" );  #SMW only
require_once( "extensions/SMWBP/LocalSettings.smwbp.ext.php" );  #optional, recommended MW ans SMW extensions
}}}
hint: you may also browse [http://semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Installation SMW setup instructions] 

6. (only if you used setup-smwplus.sh) append the following lines  to the end of LocalSettings.php
{{{
require_once( "extensions/SMWBP/LocalSettings.smwbp.smw.php" );  #SMW only
require_once( "extensions/SMWBP/LocalSettings.smwbp.ext.php" );  #optional, recommended MW ans SMW extensions
require_once( "extensions/SMWBP/LocalSettings.smwbp.smwplus.php" );  #SMW+ only
}}}
